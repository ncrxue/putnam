### Week 3
- Polynomials: I got a bit lazy that week...

### Week 4
- Polynomials (again): Problem 5 - P(P'(x)) = P'(P(x))

### Week 5
- Calculus: in-progess...
- [Problem of the Fortnight #3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Jm7if1L3cvq4VNzReVsUUpa0n8S56mw/view?usp=sharing) (Note: this is actually a re-write of Week 1 Problem 2, since the current Problem of the Fortnight happened to be the exact same problem. What a coincidence!)
